          <p>It's almost a rite of passage. Ask any experienced trader about their first account, and you'll likely hear the same story: early wins, growing confidence, increasing size, then everything gone.</p>
          <p>The sequence is so predictable it might as well be scripted. And yet new traders keep following the same script, convinced it won't happen to them.</p>
          <p>Until it does.</p>

          <hr>

          <h2>Stage 1: The Early Wins</h2>
          <p>Almost every blown account starts with success.</p>
          <p>This sounds backwards, but it's how it works. The trader deposits money, makes a few trades, and profits. Maybe they caught a trending market. Maybe they got lucky. Doesn't matter. What matters is the conclusion their brain draws:</p>
          <p>"I'm good at this."</p>
          <p>These early wins are the most dangerous moment in a trading career. Not because winning is bad, but because the brain is terrible at distinguishing skill from luck - especially on small sample sizes.</p>
          <p>You won five trades in a row. That's a 3% probability by chance alone (assuming 50/50). Feels like confirmation you've figured something out. Actually proves nothing.</p>

          <hr>

          <h2>Stage 2: The Confidence Surge</h2>
          <p>Winning creates confidence. Confidence feels good. Confidence also changes behavior.</p>
          <p>You start sizing up. The plan said 1% risk per trade, but why leave money on the table when you're clearly seeing the market well? You go to 2%. Then 3%.</p>
          <p>You start taking more trades. Your edge was one specific setup, but you're hot right now. Surely you can apply the same skills to other setups?</p>
          <p>You stop respecting risk. Stops feel like unnecessary obstacles. You've been right so much, why give the market a chance to stop you out?</p>
          <p>None of this feels reckless. It feels like evolution. You're growing as a trader.</p>

          <hr>

          <h2>Stage 3: The Death Spiral</h2>
          <p>Then the losses start. Not dramatically - not yet. Just a losing trade. Then another.</p>
          <p>But you're now risking 3-4% per trade. Two losses and you're down 8%. Three losses and you're down 12%. The gains from weeks of trading evaporate in days.</p>
          <p>This is where denial kicks in. Instead of recognizing that you've increased risk and need to scale back, you do the opposite:</p>
          <p>"I need to make it back."</p>
          <p>You size up further. The market owes you. You were right before; you'll be right again.</p>
          <p>Now the math turns brutal. You're down 20%. To get back to breakeven, you need a 25% gain. You risk 5% on the next trade. It loses. Now you're down 25%. You need a 33% gain to recover.</p>
          <p>The hole keeps getting deeper. Each loss makes the required recovery larger. The spiral accelerates.</p>
          <p>Then it's gone.</p>

          <hr>

          <h2>How to Avoid It</h2>
          <p>Knowing the stages helps, but knowledge alone doesn't stop the script. You need structural protections:</p>
          <p><strong>Fixed Position Sizing (No Exceptions)</strong></p>
          <p>Decide on your risk per trade before you start trading. 1% is standard. 0.5% is safer. Write it down. Then never, ever change it during a winning streak.</p>
          <p><strong>Drawdown Protocols</strong></p>
          <p>Decide in advance what you'll do at different drawdown levels:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Down 5%: Trade normally, but no new positions until next week</li>
            <li>Down 10%: Reduce position size by half. Mandatory 3-day break</li>
            <li>Down 15%: Stop trading. Review everything.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Early Win Skepticism</strong></p>
          <p>When you start trading, assume your early results are luck. Not because they definitely are, but because you can't know yet. You need 50-100 trades minimum to have any statistical significance.</p>
          <p><strong>Separate the Account Mentally</strong></p>
          <p>Consider your first account "education money." Expect to lose it. This sounds defeatist; it's actually liberating. When you accept that the first account is tuition, you stop trying to get rich from it.</p>

          <hr>

          <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
          <p>Blown first accounts follow a predictable script: early wins create overconfidence, overconfidence increases risk, increased risk amplifies losses, losses trigger revenge trading, and the spiral ends in zero.</p>
          <p>Break the script with structural protections: fixed position sizing, drawdown protocols, skepticism about early wins, and treating the first account as education rather than income.</p>
          <p>The traders who survive their first year aren't smarter or luckier. They're the ones who refused to size up when winning felt easy.</p>

          <hr>

          <h2>When Objective Data Beats Emotional Pull</h2>
          <p>The death spiral happens because emotions override judgment. You feel like you should size up. You feel like the market owes you. You feel like this next trade will fix everything.</p>
          <p>Objective indicators can't eliminate feelings. But they can provide counterweight.</p>
          <p>Imagine you're on a winning streak. Confidence is high. You're ready to double your size. Then you check:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Cycle phase:</strong> CAP (Climax) - not IGN (Ignition). The easy money phase is ending.</li>
            <li><strong>Volume regime:</strong> Distribution, not accumulation. Smart money is exiting.</li>
            <li><strong>Confluence score:</strong> 4 out of 10. Systems disagree. Low-probability environment.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Now you have data saying "wait" when emotions say "go." That conflict creates pause. And that pause might save your account.</p>
          <p>The best traders don't have superhuman discipline. They have systems that flag when conditions don't match their confidence. When the data says caution and your gut says aggression, the data is usually right.</p>

            <p>Signal Pilot's suite provides the objective counterweight: Pentarch shows cycle phase (is this really a good time to size up?). Volume Oracle reveals institutional behavior (are smart money traders with you or against you?). OmniDeck's confluence score tells you whether conditions actually support your thesis.</p>
