      <div class="article-content">
        <div class="container-narrow">
          <p>Every trading strategy, no matter how complex, ultimately comes down to one question: where are buyers likely to step in, and where are sellers likely to show up?</p>
          <p>Those places are called support and resistance. Master them, and you understand the battlefield every trade is fought on.</p>

          <hr>

          <h2>The Basic Concept</h2>
          <p><strong>Support</strong> is a price level where buying pressure is expected to be strong enough to stop a decline. Price has bounced here before, so traders expect it to bounce again.</p>
          <p><strong>Resistance</strong> is a price level where selling pressure is expected to be strong enough to stop a rally. Price has stalled here before, so traders expect it to stall again.</p>
          <p>Think of support as a floor - price bounces off it. Resistance is a ceiling - price gets pushed back down from it.</p>
          <p>But here's the key insight: support and resistance work because traders believe they work. They're self-fulfilling. When enough people expect a level to hold, they place orders there, and those orders make the level hold.</p>

          <hr>

          <h2>How Levels Form</h2>
          <p>Support and resistance form through prior price action. Here's where to look:</p>
          <p><strong>Prior swing highs and lows.</strong> If price reversed at $50 before, that $50 level has memory. Traders who bought at $50 and watched it drop will sell when they "get back to even." Traders who missed the rally from $50 will buy when they get another chance.</p>
          <p><strong>Round numbers.</strong> Psychological levels like $100, $50, $10 act as support and resistance because humans think in round numbers. More orders cluster at these prices.</p>
          <p><strong>Consolidation zones.</strong> Where price spent a lot of time trading sideways, many positions were established. Those traders will act when price returns to "their" zone.</p>
          <p><strong>Gap fills.</strong> Gaps often get "filled" - price returns to close the gap. The gap's edges become important levels.</p>
          <p><strong>Moving averages.</strong> The 50-day and 200-day moving averages act as dynamic support/resistance because so many traders watch them.</p>

          <hr>

          <h2>Zones, Not Lines</h2>
          <p>New traders make a critical mistake: they think support and resistance are exact prices. They're not. They're zones.</p>
          <p>Price might bounce at $50.12 one time, $49.87 the next, $50.45 the third. All of these are the "$50 level." Trying to pin it to an exact penny gets you stopped out on noise.</p>
          <p>Think in areas: "The $49.50 to $50.50 zone is support." This gives you room for the messiness of real markets.</p>
          <p>The stronger and more tested a level, the wider the zone you should consider. A level that's held five times creates more memory (and more orders) than one that's held once.</p>

          <hr>

          <h2>Role Reversal</h2>
          <p>Here's where it gets interesting: when support breaks, it often becomes resistance. When resistance breaks, it often becomes support.</p>
          <p><strong>Why?</strong> Psychology.</p>
          <p>Imagine support at $50 breaks and price drops to $45. All those traders who bought at $50 are now underwater. If price rallies back to $50, many will sell to "get back to even." Their collective selling creates resistance at what used to be support.</p>
          <p>The same works in reverse. If resistance at $60 breaks and price rallies to $65, traders who sold at $60 are now losing on their shorts. If price pulls back to $60, they'll cover - their buying creates support at what used to be resistance.</p>
          <p>This "polarity" principle is one of the most reliable phenomena in technical analysis.</p>

          <hr>

          <h2>Testing and Strength</h2>
          <p>Not all levels are equal. Some factors make support and resistance stronger:</p>
          <p><strong>Multiple touches.</strong> A level that's held three times is stronger than one that's held once. Each test that holds reinforces the level in traders' minds.</p>
          <p><strong>Higher timeframe.</strong> A support level on the daily chart is more significant than one on the 5-minute chart. More traders see it, more orders sit there.</p>
          <p><strong>Confluence.</strong> When multiple factors align at the same price - a prior high, a round number, and a moving average all at $100 - that level is much stronger than any single factor alone.</p>
          <p><strong>Volume.</strong> Levels where heavy volume occurred are more significant. That volume represents real positions that need to be dealt with.</p>
          <p><strong>Recency.</strong> Recent levels are more relevant than ancient ones. A support from last week is more actionable than one from five years ago.</p>

          <hr>

          <h2>Trading Support and Resistance</h2>
          <p>There are two basic approaches:</p>
          <p><strong>Bounce trading:</strong> Buy at support, sell at resistance. You're betting the level will hold. This works in ranging markets.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Wait for price to reach the level</li>
            <li>Look for rejection (wicks, reversal candles)</li>
            <li>Enter when rejection is confirmed</li>
            <li>Stop below/above the zone</li>
            <li>Target the opposite level</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Breakout trading:</strong> Buy when resistance breaks, sell when support breaks. You're betting the level will fail. This works in trending markets.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Wait for price to break through the level with conviction</li>
            <li>Look for volume confirmation</li>
            <li>Enter on the breakout or on a retest of the broken level</li>
            <li>Stop on the other side of the level</li>
            <li>Target based on the move's projected distance</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The key is knowing which environment you're in. Bounce trading during breakouts gets you run over. Breakout trading in ranges gets you chopped up.</p>

          <hr>

          <h2>The Fakeout Problem</h2>
          <p>Sometimes support breaks, everyone panics, and then price reverses and rallies. That's a fakeout - and they're common at significant levels because they trap traders and fuel the real move.</p>
          <p>How to handle fakeouts:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Wait for confirmation:</strong> Trading the break itself is often premature. Wait for a close beyond the level, or for a retest that holds.</li>
            <li><strong>Watch volume:</strong> Real breakouts usually have volume. Low-volume breaks are more likely to be fakeouts.</li>
            <li><strong>Use time:</strong> A break that holds for one candle is less convincing than one that holds for several.</li>
            <li><strong>Accept some losses:</strong> You can't avoid all fakeouts. Keep position sizes small enough that getting caught in one doesn't hurt badly.</li>
          </ul>

          <hr>

          <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
          <p>Support and resistance are the map of the market. They tell you where the key battles will be fought - where to look for entries, where to place stops, where to take profits.</p>
          <p>Think in zones, not lines. Respect role reversal. Look for confluence. And always consider context: is this a market where levels are holding, or one where they're breaking?</p>
          <p>Modern level-plotting systems go beyond manual charting by calculating Volume Profile POC (where the most volume transacted), VWAP bands across multiple periods, and session-based pivots automatically. Levels based on actual traded volume carry more weight than lines drawn through swing points - they represent where institutional orders actually filled.</p>
          <p>Every sophisticated trading strategy builds on these basics. Master support and resistance first, and everything else becomes clearer.</p>
