          <p>Open a chart. Those colorful bars aren't just decoration - they're telling you a story about every battle between buyers and sellers.</p>
          <p>Understanding candlesticks is step one of reading any chart. Here's everything you need to know - and nothing you don't.</p>

          <hr>

          <h2>Anatomy of a Candlestick</h2>
          <p>Each candlestick represents one period of time - one minute, one hour, one day, whatever your chart is set to. It shows four pieces of information:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Open:</strong> Where price started when the period began</li>
            <li><strong>High:</strong> The highest price reached during the period</li>
            <li><strong>Low:</strong> The lowest price reached during the period</li>
            <li><strong>Close:</strong> Where price ended when the period closed</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The thick part is called the <strong>body</strong>. It shows the range between open and close.</p>
          <p>The thin lines above and below are called <strong>wicks</strong> (or shadows). They show the full range from high to low.</p>
          <p><strong>Green/white candles:</strong> Close is higher than open. Buyers won this period.</p>
          <p><strong>Red/black candles:</strong> Close is lower than open. Sellers won this period.</p>

          <hr>

          <h2>What the Body Tells You</h2>
          <p>The body shows conviction. A large body means strong movement in one direction. A small body means indecision or balance between buyers and sellers.</p>
          <p><strong>Large green body:</strong> Strong buying pressure. Buyers controlled the entire period. Bullish.</p>
          <p><strong>Large red body:</strong> Strong selling pressure. Sellers controlled the entire period. Bearish.</p>
          <p><strong>Small body (either color):</strong> Neither side dominated. The market is undecided or balanced.</p>
          <p><strong>Doji (almost no body):</strong> Open and close are nearly identical. Maximum indecision. Often appears at turning points.</p>

          <hr>

          <h2>What the Wicks Tell You</h2>
          <p>Wicks show rejection. When price moves somewhere and then gets pushed back, you see a wick. The longer the wick, the stronger the rejection.</p>
          <p><strong>Long upper wick:</strong> Price tried to go higher but got pushed back down. Sellers are active at higher prices. Bearish signal.</p>
          <p><strong>Long lower wick:</strong> Price tried to go lower but got pushed back up. Buyers are active at lower prices. Bullish signal.</p>
          <p><strong>Wicks on both sides:</strong> Both buyers and sellers were active. Indecision or volatility.</p>
          <p><strong>No wicks:</strong> The open/close were the extreme prices. Very strong conviction in the body's direction.</p>

          <hr>

          <h2>Key Single-Candle Patterns</h2>
          <p>Forget memorizing 50 pattern names. These are the ones that actually matter:</p>
          <p><strong>Hammer / Hanging Man:</strong> Small body at top, long lower wick. Looks like a hammer. At the bottom of a downtrend, it's a "hammer" and suggests reversal up. At the top of an uptrend, it's a "hanging man" and suggests reversal down. Same shape, context determines meaning.</p>
          <p><strong>Inverted Hammer / Shooting Star:</strong> Small body at bottom, long upper wick. At the bottom of a downtrend, it's an "inverted hammer" (potential reversal up). At the top of an uptrend, it's a "shooting star" (potential reversal down).</p>
          <p><strong>Doji:</strong> Very small or no body. Indecision. Meaningful after a strong trend - suggests momentum is fading.</p>
          <p><strong>Marubozu:</strong> All body, no wicks. Maximum conviction. A green marubozu after a decline is very bullish. A red marubozu after a rally is very bearish.</p>

          <hr>

          <h2>Key Multi-Candle Patterns</h2>
          <p>Some patterns require two or three candles to identify:</p>
          <p><strong>Engulfing:</strong> A large candle that completely covers (engulfs) the previous candle's body. Bullish engulfing: green candle engulfs previous red candle. Bearish engulfing: red candle engulfs previous green candle. Strong reversal signal.</p>
          <p><strong>Inside Bar:</strong> A candle whose entire range (high to low) is within the previous candle's range. Represents consolidation. The breakout direction often continues.</p>
          <p><strong>Morning Star / Evening Star:</strong> Three-candle pattern. Big candle, small candle (the "star"), big candle in opposite direction. Morning star (at bottoms) and evening star (at tops) are reversal patterns.</p>

          <hr>

          <h2>Context Is Everything</h2>
          <p>Here's what most candlestick courses miss: the same pattern means different things in different contexts.</p>
          <p>A hammer at the bottom of a long downtrend, at a major support level, with high volume - that's meaningful.</p>
          <p>A hammer in the middle of a range, at no particular level, with average volume - that's noise.</p>
          <p>Before trading any candle pattern, ask:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Where is this in the trend? (Beginning, middle, end?)</li>
            <li>Is it at a significant price level? (Support, resistance, moving average?)</li>
            <li>Does volume confirm it? (High volume on reversal candles is better)</li>
            <li>What's the higher timeframe context? (A 5-minute hammer during a daily downtrend means little)</li>
          </ul>

          <hr>

          <h2>The Common Mistakes</h2>
          <p><strong>Trading every pattern:</strong> Most candle patterns are noise. Only trade patterns at significant levels with confirming context.</p>
          <p><strong>Ignoring the close:</strong> A pattern isn't confirmed until the candle closes. A hammer looks like a hammer only at the close - during the period, it could turn into anything.</p>
          <p><strong>Forgetting the trend:</strong> Reversal patterns need a trend to reverse. A "bullish engulfing" in an uptrend isn't a reversal - it's just continuation.</p>
          <p><strong>No follow-through requirement:</strong> The best traders wait for confirmation. After a hammer, they want to see the next candle close green before entering.</p>

          <hr>

          <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
          <p>Candlesticks are a language. The body tells you who won the battle. The wicks tell you who tried and failed. The context tells you whether any of it matters.</p>
          <p>Learn the basics here, then focus on context. A simple pattern at the right place is worth more than a complex pattern in the wrong place.</p>
