          <p>Every trading book tells you to honor your stop loss. Set it and forget it. Don't move it. Let the trade work.</p>
          <p>This is good advice - most of the time. But there are moments when the smart move is to exit before your stop is hit. Take a smaller loss. Preserve capital for a better opportunity.</p>
          <p>The trick is knowing when early exit is discipline and when it's fear disguised as discipline.</p>

          <hr>

          <h2>The Thesis Has Changed</h2>
          <p>You entered a trade for a reason. You saw a pattern, a setup, a catalyst. Your stop was placed where that thesis would be invalidated.</p>
          <p>But markets evolve. New information arrives. Sometimes your thesis becomes invalid before price reaches your stop.</p>
          <p><strong>Example:</strong> You bought a breakout. Price broke above resistance, you entered on the retest. Your stop is below the breakout level.</p>
          <p>But now price is churning. Volume dried up. What looked like a breakout is turning into a failed breakout. The thesis - that buyers would drive price higher after the breakout - is dying even though your stop hasn't been hit.</p>
          <p>In this case, early exit isn't panic. It's recognizing that the setup you traded no longer exists.</p>

          <hr>

          <h2>Time Invalidation</h2>
          <p>Some setups have a time component. If the expected move doesn't happen within a certain window, the setup fails even if price hasn't moved against you.</p>
          <p><strong>Momentum trades:</strong> If you're trading momentum and price goes flat, momentum is gone. Waiting for your stop to hit ties up capital in a dead trade.</p>
          <p><strong>Event trades:</strong> You bought ahead of earnings expecting a move. Earnings happen, price goes nowhere. The catalyst is spent. The trade is over regardless of where your stop sits.</p>
          <p><strong>Opening range breakouts:</strong> These typically work in the first hour or not at all. If you're still waiting at noon, the trade has failed by time, not by price.</p>
          <p>When time invalidates a trade, cut it. Don't wait for price to agree.</p>

          <hr>

          <h2>Correlation Risks Emerge</h2>
          <p>You took a trade based on individual stock analysis. Then the market tanks. Or the sector collapses. Or some macro event hits.</p>
          <p>Your individual thesis is now overwhelmed by forces you didn't account for.</p>
          <p>Your stop is still technically valid - the stock's structure hasn't broken. But the context has changed completely. The tide is going out and your boat is going with it.</p>
          <p>This is a judgment call. Sometimes individual strength holds. But if your thesis depended on a neutral or positive market and that assumption just died, waiting for your stop is often just delayed losing.</p>

          <hr>

          <h2>When NOT to Cut Early</h2>
          <p>Early exits can also be costly mistakes. Here's when to stay in:</p>
          <p><strong>Normal pullbacks:</strong> Price doesn't go straight to your target. Pullbacks within your thesis are expected. Don't exit because red candles make you uncomfortable.</p>
          <p><strong>Emotional reactions:</strong> If you're exiting because you're scared, not because something changed, that's fear, not discipline. Fear says "get me out." Analysis says "the thesis is invalidated because X."</p>
          <p><strong>Noise:</strong> Markets chop. Headlines hit. Most intraday movement is noise. If your thesis is multi-day or longer, intraday wiggles aren't invalidation.</p>
          <p><strong>The stop is close:</strong> If you're 80% of the way to your stop, you've taken most of the loss already. At that point, give the trade room to work. Early exit saves meaningful capital when the exit is actually early.</p>

          <hr>

          <h2>The "Would I Enter Here?" Test</h2>
          <p>A useful mental model: look at your current position as if you had no position.</p>
          <p>If you were flat right now, would you enter this trade at this price with this stop?</p>
          <p>If yes, stay in. The trade still makes sense.</p>
          <p>If no, ask yourself why you're holding. The only valid reason is that the trade thesis is intact. If the thesis is broken and you wouldn't enter here, exit.</p>
          <p>This removes the psychological weight of being in a losing position. You're not "giving up" or "admitting defeat." You're simply reallocating capital to where it has better expected value.</p>

          <hr>

          <h2>The Re-Entry Question</h2>
          <p>Sometimes the right move is: exit now, re-enter if the setup triggers again.</p>
          <p>This feels wrong. Exit at a loss, then potentially buy again at a worse price? But consider the alternative: hold through uncertainty, take a bigger loss, then miss the actual move because you're too beaten up to re-enter.</p>
          <p>Cutting early and re-entering is strategically sound when:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The current price action invalidates the immediate setup but not the larger thesis</li>
            <li>A new setup could form that offers better risk/reward</li>
            <li>Being in the trade is clouding your judgment</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Cash is a position. Sometimes it's the best position.</p>

          <hr>

          <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
          <p>Your stop loss is your maximum allowable loss, not your target loss.</p>
          <p>Cut early when:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Your original thesis is invalidated (not just uncomfortable)</li>
            <li>Time has expired on a time-sensitive setup</li>
            <li>Correlation risks have changed the context</li>
            <li>You wouldn't enter here if you were flat</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Stay in when:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Normal pullbacks occur within the thesis</li>
            <li>You're reacting emotionally, not analytically</li>
            <li>The stop is already close</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The skill is distinguishing analysis from emotion. One protects capital. The other bleeds it through a thousand fearful cuts.</p>
