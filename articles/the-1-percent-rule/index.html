          <p>"Never risk more than 1% of your account on a single trade."</p>
          <p>You've heard this rule. Maybe you've ignored it because it seems impossibly conservative. With a $10,000 account, 1% is only $100. How are you supposed to make money risking $100?</p>
          <p>Here's the thing: the 1% rule isn't about making money. It's about not losing it. And paradoxically, that's what actually makes money over time.</p>

          <hr>

          <h2>The Math of Ruin</h2>
          <p>Let's say you risk 10% per trade instead of 1%. Feels more like "real" trading, right?</p>
          <p>Now imagine you hit a losing streak. Not unusual - even a 60% win rate produces 5+ losses in a row fairly often.</p>
          <p><strong>At 10% risk, after 5 losses:</strong></p>
          <p>$10,000 → $9,000 → $8,100 → $7,290 → $6,561 → $5,905</p>
          <p>You've lost 41% of your account. To get back to $10,000, you need a 69% gain.</p>
          <p><strong>At 1% risk, after 5 losses:</strong></p>
          <p>$10,000 → $9,900 → $9,801 → $9,703 → $9,606 → $9,510</p>
          <p>You've lost 4.9% of your account. To get back to $10,000, you need a 5.2% gain.</p>
          <p>One scenario is a setback. The other is a potential death spiral.</p>

          <hr>

          <h2>The Asymmetry Problem</h2>
          <p>Losses and gains are not symmetrical. This is the single most important concept in risk management.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Lose 10%, need 11.1% to recover</li>
            <li>Lose 20%, need 25% to recover</li>
            <li>Lose 30%, need 42.9% to recover</li>
            <li>Lose 50%, need 100% to recover</li>
            <li>Lose 90%, need 900% to recover</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The bigger the loss, the exponentially harder recovery becomes. This is why capital preservation isn't conservative - it's essential.</p>
          <p>The 1% rule keeps you in the zone where recovery is always achievable.</p>

          <hr>

          <h2>"But I Can't Make Money at 1%"</h2>
          <p>This objection misunderstands how professional trading works.</p>
          <p>You don't make money from one trade. You make money from the cumulative edge across hundreds or thousands of trades.</p>
          <p>Let's say you have a strategy that wins 50% of the time with 2:1 reward-to-risk. Your expectancy per trade is:</p>
          <p>(0.5 x 2R) - (0.5 x 1R) = 0.5R per trade</p>
          <p>At 1% risk, that's 0.5% expected gain per trade. Over 100 trades, that's 50% account growth - not counting compounding.</p>
          <p>At 10% risk, theoretically that's 5% per trade. But you won't survive 100 trades. Variance will wipe you out during an inevitable drawdown.</p>
          <p>The 1% rule lets your edge play out. Higher risk means your edge never gets the chance.</p>

          <hr>

          <h2>The Professional Reality</h2>
          <p>Hedge funds, prop firms, and professional traders typically risk 0.5-2% per trade. Many use even less.</p>
          <p>Why? Because they understand something retail traders don't: longevity is the edge.</p>
          <p>Markets offer opportunities every day. The only way to miss them all is to blow your account. As long as you have capital, you have opportunity. The 1% rule ensures you always have capital.</p>
          <p>It's not about any single trade. It's about being there for the next thousand trades.</p>

          <hr>

          <h2>Implementing the 1% Rule</h2>
          <p>Here's the practical application:</p>
          <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Define your account risk. For a $10,000 account at 1%, that's $100.</p>
          <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Find your trade setup. Identify entry and stop loss based on market structure - not on your account math.</p>
          <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Calculate risk per share. If you're buying at $50 with a stop at $48, your risk per share is $2.</p>
          <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Size accordingly. $100 account risk / $2 per share = 50 shares.</p>
          <p>If the structural stop requires more risk than 1% allows, you have two choices: trade smaller, or skip the trade entirely. You never move the stop to accommodate your desired size.</p>

          <hr>

          <h2>When to Adjust</h2>
          <p>The 1% rule is a maximum, not a target. Consider risking less when:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>You're in a drawdown.</strong> Some traders drop to 0.5% after a 10% account decline.</li>
            <li><strong>Volatility is elevated.</strong> Stops are more likely to get blown through in volatile markets.</li>
            <li><strong>You have correlated positions.</strong> Five 1% positions in tech stocks is really one 5% position in tech.</li>
            <li><strong>You're uncertain.</strong> Lower conviction = lower size.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>There is never a reason to risk more than 1-2%. "High conviction" doesn't change math. Every blown account was high conviction on the way down.</p>

          <hr>

          <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
          <p>The 1% rule isn't about being timid. It's about understanding that trading is a game of survival first, profits second.</p>
          <p>Risk small. Trade often. Let your edge compound. That's how professionals build wealth from trading.</p>
          <p>The traders who ignore this advice are the ones who fund the accounts of traders who follow it.</p>
