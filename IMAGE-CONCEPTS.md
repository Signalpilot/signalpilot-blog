# Signal Pilot Blog - Image Concept Guide for DALL-E / Midjourney

Prompts for generating hero images. Match Signal Pilot's dark, sophisticated aesthetic.

## HOW TO USE
1. Generate images using the prompts below (DALL-E or Midjourney)
2. Export as WebP format, ~1600x900px, under 200KB
3. Save to `/assets/images/` with the filename specified
4. The HTML already has placeholders pointing to these files

### PRIORITY IMAGES (already in HTML)

**hero-inside-signal-pilot.webp**

7 interconnected glowing nodes in hexagonal pattern. Each node different shade of cyan/blue. Futuristic dashboard UI showing integration. Dark #05070d background. Minimalist abstract. --ar 16:9 --style raw --no text
```

**hero-indicators-failing.webp**
```
Multiple conflicting arrows/signals pointing different directions creating visual chaos. Different colors clashing (red, green, yellow, blue). Dark background. Abstract minimalist. --ar 16:9 --style raw --no text
```

**hero-repainting-problem.webp**

Candlestick chart with signals visibly shifting - ghostly faded versions showing where signals moved from. Deceptive unsettling feel. Red/amber warning tones. Dark background. --ar 16:9 --style raw --no text
```

**hero-pentarch-cycles.webp**
```
5 cycle phases as geometric shapes transitioning into each other in a flow. First=green, second=cyan, third=gold, fourth=amber, fifth=red. Phases flowing between each other. Dark background. --ar 16:9 --style raw --no text
```

**hero-free-vs-pro.webp**
```
Split image - left side chaotic unaligned signals in clashing colors, right side clean harmonized signals in coordinated cyan. Clear visual contrast between chaos and clarity. Dark background. --ar 16:9 --style raw --no text
```

**hero-confirmation-trap.webp**
```
Trader silhouette trapped in a cage made of glowing indicator signals. Too many inputs creating paralysis. Frozen figure. Dark claustrophobic feel with glowing cyan cage bars. --ar 16:9 --style raw --no text
```

**hero-blow-account.webp**
```
Spiral descending from green at top through gold to red at bottom, ending in darkness. Classic blow-up trajectory. Dramatic but clean geometric spiral. Dark background. --ar 16:9 --style raw --no text
```

## GENERAL PURPOSE

```
"Clarity" - Single clear path of light cutting through fog. Cyan path, murky surroundings. Finding signal in noise. --ar 16:9 --style raw --no text

"Integration" - Multiple light streams converging to single bright point. Data synthesizing into one answer. --ar 16:9 --style raw --no text

## TECHNICAL NOTES

**Midjourney:** Add `--ar 16:9 --style raw --no text, words, letters`

**DALL-E:** Use clear descriptions, specify "minimalist abstract dark background professional trading aesthetic"

**Post-processing:** Compress to WebP ~100-200KB, add gradient overlay for text readability
